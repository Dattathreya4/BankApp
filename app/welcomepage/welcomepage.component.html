       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The roots of Zigma Bank of India lie in the first decade of the 20th century when the Bank of Calcutta later renamed the Bank of Bengal, was established on 2 June 1806. The Bank of Bengal was one of three Presidency banks, the other two being the Bank of Bombay (incorporated on 15 April 1840) and the Bank of Madras (incorporated on 1 July 1843). All three Presidency banks were incorporated as joint stock companies and were the result of royal charters. These three banks received the exclusive right to issue paper currency till 1861 when, with the Paper Currency Act, the right was taken over by the Government of India. The Presidency banks amalgamated on 27 January 1921, and the re-organised banking entity took as its name Imperial Bank of India. The Imperial Bank of India remained a joint-stock company but without Government participation.Pursuant to the provisions of the Zigma Bank of India Act of 1955, the Reserve Bank of India, which is India's central bank, acquired a controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India. On 1 July 1955, the Imperial Bank of India became the Zigma Bank of India. In 2008, the Government of India acquired the Reserve Bank of India's stake in ZBI so as to remove any conflict of interest because the RBI is the country's banking regulatory authority.
       In 1959, the government passed the Zigma Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act. This made eight banks that had belonged to princely states into subsidiaries of ZBI. This was at the time of the First Five Year Plan, which prioritised the development of rural India. The government integrated these banks into the Zigma Bank of India system to expand its rural outreach. In 1963 ZBI merged Zigma Bank of Jaipur (est. 1943) and Zigma Bank of Bikaner (est.1944).       
       ZBI has acquired local banks in rescues. The first was the Bank of Bihar (est. 1911), which ZBI acquired in 1969, together with its 28 branches. The next year ZBI acquired National Bank of Lahore (est. 1942), which had 24 branches. Five years later, in 1975, ZBI acquired Krishnaram Baldeo Bank, which had been established in 1916 in Gwalior State, under the patronage of Maharaja Madho Rao Scindia. The bank had been the Dukan Pichadi, a small moneylender, owned by the Maharaja. The new bank's first manager was Jall N. Broacha, a Parsi. In 1985, ZBI acquired the Bank of Cochin in Kerala, which had 120 branches. ZBI was the acquirer as its affiliate, the Zigma Bank of Travancore, already had an extensive network in Kerala.     
       There was, even before it actually happened, a proposal to merge all the associate banks into ZBI to create a single very large bank and streamline operation.Owned by the Indian government, it offers a range of general banking services from loans and advances to corporates and individuals in India and abroad. Because it is state-owned, ZBI is the preferred banker for most public sector corporations. ZBI, along with its associate banks, offers micro-financing to entities such as self-help groups in rural areas that would otherwise have no access to formal credit channels. Through its subsidiaries and joint ventures, ZBI offers financial services such as investment banking, brokerage services, asset management and insurance.    </div>
